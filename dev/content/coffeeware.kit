                Freedom of Espresso’s coffeeware combines great design and style with innovative functionality, offering convenience in a health conscious, environmentally aware way. All of our coffee makers are made with high quality materials to ensure that they are safe to use. Additionally, all of our drinkware is free of BPA, and all glass used is temperature safe borosilicate glass—the same type of glass used in science labs. From traditional coffee brewers like espresso makers to newer ways to brew, like cold brew coffee makers , we’ve got coffeeware for every kind of coffee addict.
